        <h3>What is <em>Cereal</em>?</h3>
        <p>You may be asking yourself "What the hell is cereal?" No worries, its not as strange as it sounds. Cereal is a desert (typically eaten for breakfast) made from the lactate of mammals (typically cows) and a mysterious grain & sugar mixture found in boxes (convienently called "cereal boxes") at grocery stores.</p>
        <h3>What you will need:</h3>
        <ul><li>mammal lactate</li>
        <li>a cereal box (preferrably with cereal inside)</li>
        <li>a bowl (a cup will work too!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How its made:</h3>
        <ol><li>Take a deep breath (this is gonna be hard, but you can do this)</li>
        <li>Pour the mammal lactate in the bowl... Just Kidding! Pour the cereal in first! (youll quickly learn this order is crucial.)</li>
        <li>Now that the cereal is in the bowl, pour the milk... I mean lactate into the bowl with cereal.</li>
        <li>Lastly, you will want to grab a spoon (oh yeah, did I forget to mention you'll need a spoon?), stir the cereal pieces around the lactate a bit, mixing it all in, then take a spoonful and enjoy!</li></ol>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! You've made your first bowl of cereal and can now enjoy desert for breakfast!</p>
