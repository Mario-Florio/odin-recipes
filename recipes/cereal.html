        <h1>How to Make <em>Cereal</em></h1>
        <p>You may be asking yourself "what the hell is cereal? Well, cereal is desert (typically eaten for breakfast) made from the lactate of mammals (typically cows) and a mysterious grain & sugar mixture found in a boxes (convienently called "cereal boxes") at grocery stores.</p>

        </ul>
        <h6>How its made:</h6>
        <ol><li>Take a deep breath (this is gonna be hard, but you can do this)</li>
        <li>Pour the mammal lactate in the bowl... Just Kidding! Pour the cereal in first! (youll quickly learn this order is crucial.)</li>
        <li>Now that the cereal is in the bowl, pour the milk... I mean lactate into the bowl with cereal.</li>
        <li>Lastly, you will want to grab a spoon (oh yeah, did I forget to mention you'll need a spoon?), stir the cereal pieces around the lactate a bit, mixing it all in, then take a spoonful and enjoy!</li></ol>
        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>Congratulations! You've made your first bowl of cereal and can enjoy desert for breakfast for now on!</p>
